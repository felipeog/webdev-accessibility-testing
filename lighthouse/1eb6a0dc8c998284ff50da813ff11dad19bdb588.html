If the target is the entire page,\n  use \'report\' for the component. The property name should not be abbreviated. Use the\n  property name the variable is intended for - if it\'s used for multiple, a common descriptor\n  is fine (ex: \'size\' for a variable applied to \'width\' and \'height\'). If a variable is shared\n  across multiple components, either create more variables or just drop the "{component}-"\n  part of the name. Append any modifiers at the end (ex: \'big\', \'dark\').\n\n  For colors: --color-{hue}-{intensity}\n\n  {intensity} is the Material Design tag - 700, A700, etc.\n*/\n.lh-vars {\n  /* Palette using
